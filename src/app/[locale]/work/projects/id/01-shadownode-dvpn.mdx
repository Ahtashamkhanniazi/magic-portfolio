## Overview

Shadow Node is a decentralized VPN (dVPN) platform utilizing blockchain technology to offer secure, private, and efficient internet access. Unlike traditional VPNs, Shadow Node operates via a network of user-managed nodes, enhancing both security and privacy. As the Full Stack Developer, I was responsible for building the website and dashboard for Shadow Node, providing users with an intuitive platform to interact with and manage the dVPN.

## Key Features

- **Website and Dashboard Development**: Created a user-friendly website to present Shadow Node's core features such as decentralization, performance enhancements, and a strict no-log policy. Developed a dashboard where users could stake $SVPN tokens, manage nodes, and monitor rewards.
- **Decentralized Security Protocols**: Integrated secure authentication and privacy protocols across all features, ensuring user data is protected at every step.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Implemented blockchain functionalities, allowing users to interact seamlessly with decentralized components of the VPN. The integration included token staking, reward tracking, and decentralized node management.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Material-UI, Emotion for building responsive and modular interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js for API management and backend logic.
- **Blockchain**: Web3.js, Ethers.js, Wagmi for secure and efficient blockchain integration.
- **Database**: MongoDB for robust, scalable data management.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was integrating blockchain features like token staking and decentralized node management while maintaining a seamless user experience. Working with blockchain protocols required additional security measures and testing to ensure reliable data protection. Another key learning was optimizing performance with decentralized systems, as network speed and user experience were critical to the projectâ€™s success.

## Outcome

The Shadow Node platform successfully launched, enabling users to enjoy a secure, private, and decentralized VPN experience. The website and dashboard have received positive feedback for their intuitive design and functionality. The project has set a new benchmark for integrating blockchain with VPN technology, positioning Shadow Node as a pioneering solution in the dVPN space.

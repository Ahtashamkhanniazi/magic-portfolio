## Introduction

**Myro** is a cryptocurrency inspired by Solana co-founder Raj Gokal’s dog, designed to be simple, secure, and inclusive. I was responsible for developing the front end of Myro’s website and dashboard, crafting an engaging interface to promote **$MYRO** and its features.

## Client Background

The client aimed to combine the popular dog-themed crypto trend with Solana’s technology. **Myro** was developed to offer an accessible, user-friendly crypto experience while highlighting Solana's potential.

## Challenge

The challenge was to design a front end that balanced Myro's playful branding with functionality. The platform needed to clearly explain how to purchase **$MYRO** and pre-order Myro plushies while keeping the design simple and secure.

## Front-End Development

I developed the Myro website and dashboard using **React.js**, **Material UI**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The front end allows users to purchase **$MYRO** via Phantom wallet or exchanges and includes a feature for pre-ordering Myro plushies. The interface is user-friendly, enabling users to track token holdings and engage with Myro’s community.

## Results

The final product delivered an intuitive and engaging experience, making it easy for users to interact with **$MYRO** and the plushie pre-order feature. The website effectively communicated Myro’s story, driving both engagement and adoption.

## Conclusion

Myro’s platform blends playful branding with functionality, offering users a seamless and secure experience. The front-end design enhances user interaction and community engagement.
